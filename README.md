# Mukh-O-Mukhosh (Bengali: মুখ ও মুখোশ)

- A face mask detector model
- The name Mukh-O-Mukhosh is inspired from the name of the the first Bengali language feature film 'Mukh O Mukhosh' (Bengali: মুখ ও মুখোশ, lit. 'The Face and the Mask') which was released back in 1956. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukh_O_Mukhosh
